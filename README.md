# Kernel - A plug & play Riot API proxy server
Kernel is built on top of [orianna](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna), a Riot API wrapper and framework for working with API data. The API kernel provides mirrors the [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com/api-methods/), and allows users to proxy their API calls through kernel to avoid "leaking" their Riot API key to end users.

Kernel is built using [JAX-RS](https://github.com/jax-rs) and [RestEasy](https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy), and is currently built for the [Wildfly](http://www.wildfly.org/) [JBoss](http://www.jboss.org/) application server.

Kernel is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

## Features
Kernel also includes the following built-in features:
  - Automatic rate limit handling for the Riot API
  - Configurable strategies for handling Riot API errors (retry, expontential backoff, return null, etc)
  - A configurable pipeline for automatic caching of API results
    - Plug & Play support for several common databases in the works [here](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna-datastores)
  - Support for [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) serialization in addition to JSON

## API Differences from Riot API
Kernel is intended to mirror the Riot API exactly. The Riot API, however, is distributed accross regional platform domains to split computation load and localize content distribution (e.g. na1.api.riotgames.com or euw1.api.riotgames.com). Kernel supports serving _all_ platforms from a single server instance using the `platform` query parameter, which is available for every API endpoint in kernel. All Riot API platforms are supported by this feature. A default platform can be configured to direct requests without a `platform` query parameter to that platform.

## How to get it
Kernel can be obtained and installed either through [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or by building the application locally using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and deploying it to a local [Wildfly](http://www.wildfly.org/) application server.

### Docker
- Install & Configure Docker
  - [Windows 10 Professional](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) (or other windows version with Hyper-V support)
  - [Other Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)
  - [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
  - [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
  - [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
  - [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
  - [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Choose an off-the-shelf configuration of Kernel to use and download the `docker-compose.yml` file associated with it
  - [Base Configuration (No Caching Included)](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel/tree/master/kernel-wildfly/src/configurations/base)
  - [MongoDB Configuration](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel/tree/master/kernel-wildfly/src/configurations/mongo)
  - [More configurations forthcoming as support for additional popular databases is completed for orianna](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna-datastores)
- Set your `RIOT_API_KEY` environment variable to your [Riot API Key](https://developer.riotgames.com/)
- Navigate to the directory where you downloaded `docker-compose.yml` on your local machine and open a terminal or command prompt
  - Run `docker-compose up -d` to lanch Kernel in the background
  - Run `docker-compose down` to shut down Kernel
- The default `docker-compose.yml` files will start Kernel on port 80, as well as launching a [Swagger UI](https://hub.docker.com/r/swaggerapi/swagger-ui/) on port 12357 to explore the API.

If you want to change some configuration settings in Kernel, you can edit the `kernel-config.json` file from the configuration you chose, then add a volume entry to the `docker-comopse.yml` file to load your config into the container. Example: [original compose file](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel/blob/master/kernel-wildfly/src/configurations/base/docker-compose.yml) | [compose file with custom kernel-config.json](https://gist.github.com/robrua/9a89b908e2a6c3848cc4ab3ec5a0638e)

### Maven & Wildfly
- Install [JDK 8 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
- Download and unpack [Wildfly](http://wildfly.org/downloads/)
- Clone the kernel source code locally & navigate to the folder
- Run `mvn clean install` to build the application. Some maven profiles are available to bundle datastore dependencies in with the application. Use `mvn clean install -P some,profile,names` to activate them:
  - [mongo](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/kernel/blob/master/kernel-wildfly/pom.xml#L94-L138)
  - [More configurations forthcoming as support for additional popular databases is completed for orianna](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna-datastores)
- From your kernel source folder, copy `kernel-wildfly/target/lol.war` into the `standalone/deployments/` directory in your Wildfly folder
- From your kernel source folder, copy both files (`kernel-config.json` and `module.xml`) from `kernel-wildfly/src/main/modules/com/merakianalytics/kernel/kernel-jboss-module/main/` into the `modules/com/merakianalytics/kernel/kernel-jboss-module/main/` directory in your Wildfly folder. You will probably need to create all the directories beyond `modules/`.
- Run `bin/standalone.sh` (Unix) or `bin/standalone.bat` (Windows) in your Wildfly folder to launch Kernel.
